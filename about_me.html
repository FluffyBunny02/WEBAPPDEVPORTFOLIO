            <h3> Aspiring Game Developer </h3>
            <p>To introduce myself more, I am now 21 years old. I currently live in Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte. </p>
            <p>My likes? I like food I guess lmao. Though I do have an allergy towards seafood. I like music too. a lot. There's not a genre that I'd say I hate. I like to dance and sing too but I'm only decent at it.</p>
            <p>My hobbies? I like to play the Guitar and the Ukulele. I do know a bit of piano but I am haven't really mastered it yet. I have a burning passion for games. Since I was a kid, I had been more exposed to computers and the games that came a long with it. If I had to say what my first game was, It was probably Contra.</p>
            <p>Why I chose BSIT Course? When I was I guess 15 or 16, I had this epiphany one time when I was gaming and it hit me, I'm having fun and I'm happy and no one's gonna take this away from me. And then I thought that wow, these developers have touched people's lives and I wanna be able to do that too. So I started pursuing learning more about how to actually develop stuff and now, i'm here. A bit worn and battered but I hope I can make something of myself. The notes app in my phone has probably about 10+ games ideas that are to blossom yet.</p>
            <p>Anything to more to say? Genshin UID: 610469867</p>
